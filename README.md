# AI-Trainer
An AI-based gym trainer in Python using Mediapipe and OpenCV is a software application that helps individuals perform exercises correctly and receive real-time feedback on their technique. The system uses computer vision to track the user's movements using their webcam and compares it to a database of correct movement patterns. If the user's movements deviate from the correct form, the system provides feedback on how to adjust their technique.
This AI-based gym trainer can be used for various exercises such as push-ups, squats, lunges, and more. It helps individuals to perform exercises safely and efficiently without the need for a human trainer. Additionally, the system can keep track of the user's progress over time, providing personalized recommendations and feedback based on their performance.
